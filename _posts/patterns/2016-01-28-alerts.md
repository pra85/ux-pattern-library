description:    Examples of alerts in a semi-real world context.

info:           When something goes wrong, alerts clarify an issue and/or notify users of the problem, communicate the severity of the issue, and provide an actionable next step, if necessary. When implementing the alert pattern, consider the alertâ€™s location; closer proximity to the action/event associates the issue (and hence resolution) with a specific page element, whereas more distant placement communicates a more systematic issue. Seek to balance graphic and content elements, where less is usually more. We recommend reading stuff about "microcopy."
